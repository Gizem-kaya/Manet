> An implementation a program that simulates MANET. In this project we call simulator as AdHocSim. It is first established the network then found possible routes between sender and receiver nodes finally chosee optimal route among them. To accomplish this task we use recursion while constructing the possible routes.

### Setting-up the Nodes and the Neighbors

MANET comprises of nodes that communicate each other directly or indirectly by employing other nodes as routers in the case of they are not located within the communication range. In this assignment, a node carries three different information: 
1. location, 
2. transmission range,
3. residual battery level. For example, node A is located at (120,45) and has 80% battery level (see Fig. 1).

In order to determine neighborhood of each node, it is first needed to examine the location and transmission range information. To say
A is one of the neighbors of B, A should be within the transmission range of B. As mentioned, every node has location and transmission
range information which is determined by east (x1), west (x2), north (y1), and south (y2) coordinate limits. For example B and C are the two neighbors of A (see Fig. 2). 

Note: To represent neighborhood we  construct a dictionary where key is node label and its corresponding value is its neighbors, as illustrated follows. There is an example of dictionary that stores relations:

'A': ['B', 'C']
'B': ['D', 'E']
'C': ['F', 'H']
'D': ['E', 'G']
'E': ['G']
'F': ['G', 'H']
'G': ['I']
'H': []
'I': []

### Route Finding in MANET

We may think of a network as a directed graph where nodes represent vertices whereas communication links represent edges. A graph might be cyclic or acyclic. A graph is said to be cyclic if there exists some vertices that are connected in a closed chain (see Fig. 2 for an example of acyclic graph).

Concretely speaking, there might be a case where the next node is a node that has already been visited before. After setting up the nodes and determining of neighbors of every node, we obtain a network ready-to-use. Before transmission of first packet begins, it is needed to find a path through which packets are transferred. This path is called as route that starts and ends with a sender and destination nodes, respectively. Remember that route consists of only sender and destination nodes if they are within each otherâ€™s transmission range. But, on the other, they employ other nodes as intermediate nodes by treating them routers for transmission of a collection of packets. To clarify the routing process in MANET, we make use of Fig. 3. From the figure, sender node A is ready to initiate a data transfer to destination node I and there exist four routes between A and I. (Note: There might be cases where there is no route between any given two nodes.) A step by step route finding process is demonstrated with figures at the end of this document. With a similar way, we found every possible routes, using recursion, with its cost whose calculation is explained in the following section.
